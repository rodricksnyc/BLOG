      <h1>Trump: The Boyfriend They Can't Quit<br>by Elizabeth</h1>
      <br>
      <h5>
        As we are on the precipice of war with North Korea, a Constitutional crisis, and losing our planet to the effects of climate change, I often wonder, what happened to the good people of this country? Have they simply abandoned their lifelong values, only to adopt new ones admired by bedlamites, or is the shift in this country rooted in something much deeper than many of us are able to recognize? The day after the election, I was in complete shock and by Thanksgiving, I was still mystified; the extreme adulation that Trump supporters offered then, and still offer now, made no sense to me, especially from the women. Being from New York and a woman myself, I have many times endured the creepiness of perverts making demeaning remarks about my appearance, and have even had my genitals groped on the subway. Over the years, I have seen Trump make remarks about women, rating their “hotness” and letting the world know who he would or would not sleep with, depending on whether or not they satisfied his standards of beauty; and from his interaction with women, it is very apparent that he believes women were put on this earth to look good in a bikini and prance around half-naked on stage. Yet this did not stop women from voting for him.
        <br>
        <br>
        The day after Thanksgiving, I learned that it was white working-class women that put Trump over the edge. Before the election, I had watched hundreds of women come to Trump’s rescue on social media, excusing his behavior with an almost unanimous declaration; that Trump was just an average guy, not a politician, who wanted to help Americans prosper — so what that he makes fun of the disabled and is a misogynistic bigot. To them, they saw Trump as both the guy next door and the fast-talking, savvy New York businessman, who knew how to get things done. But here it is, almost a year later, and I am still observing the same women defend Trump on social media. The same women who have witnessed and tolerated this man-child’s temper tantrums and scurrilous outbursts, without reaping any benefits from his presidency, are still relentlessly coming to his defense, bashing anyone along the way who questions their loyalty.
        <br>
        <br>
        Initially, women were drawn to Trump because they were envious of Hillary; the successful, smart, ambitious woman, who had surpassed what most women would accomplish career-wise, tenfold. But they also liked Trump's charisma and made excuses for his repugnant behavior, because as women, that’s what most of us do; we get into relationships with men and when we discover characteristics we don’t like about the person we’re dating, we ignore them, with the hope that they will change. Of course they never do, but we end up sticking with the guy anyway, despite all of their undesirable behavior — at least longer than we should. And this partly explains where female Trump supporters are today; they cannot admit they made a mistake and move on, rather they dig their heels in the ground even harder. Because if they admit they helped get a sociopath elected, what would that say about themselves? That they fell for a con-artist who is taking advantage of them and they were too foolish or naive to see this coming? No, they would rather stick it out and suffer the consequences.
        <br>
        <br>
        And so this brings me back to my initial question; what happened to the good people of this country? It would be easy to write Trump supporters off as idiots, racists, or mentally ill— and many of them are. But just like the female Trump supporters, the male supporters are also now playing the role of a woman who has decided to stay in a dysfunctional relationship; they are still hoping the man of their dreams will change, and they cannot admit that they are instead, dating a lunatic.

  <h4>Selected Readings On Trump: Con Man of the Century</h4>

  <img class="left" src="img/edsall.jpg">
  <h1>The Apotheosis of Donald J. Trump
    <br>by Thomas B. Edsall
  </h1>
  <br>
  <h5>No previous nominee has been so much the creation of social media and so little the creation of a political party.

    Trump’s violation of ethical and business norms are available for all to see. (For an exhaustive and informative compendium, see the Atlantic’s recent summary, “The Many Scandals of Donald Trump: A Cheat Sheet.”)

    While Haley Barbour, a former Republican National Committee chairman, called it a “nothingburger,” allegations that on the opening night of the convention Melania Trump plagiarized a Michelle Obama speech reinforced the image of Trump and his family as duplicitous. Michael Murphy, a former supporter of Jeb Bush, called the mood among Republican operatives on Tuesday morning “something between grim resignation and the Donner Party.”

    Perhaps most important is the acquiescence of the Republican Party and of a large segment of the voting public to Trump’s flagrant disregard for democratic procedure in politics and governing.

    <img class="right" src="img/blow3.jpg"><h2>No, Trump, We Can’t Just Get Along<br>by Charles M. Blow</h2>
    <br>
    <h5>You are a fraud and a charlatan. Yes, you will be president, but you will not get any breaks just because one branch of your forked tongue is silver.

      I am not easily duped by dopes.

      I have not only an ethical and professional duty to call out how obscene your very existence is at the top of American government; I have a moral obligation to do so.

      I’m not trying to convince anyone of anything, but rather to speak up for truth and honor and inclusion. This isn’t just about you, but also about the moral compass of those who see you for who and what you are, and know the darkness you herald is only held at bay by the lights of truth.

      It’s not that I don’t believe that people can change and grow. They can. But real growth comes from the accepting of responsibility and repenting of culpability. Expedient reversal isn’t growth; it’s gross.

      So let me say this on Thanksgiving: I’m thankful to have this platform because as long as there are ink and pixels, you will be the focus of my withering gaze.

      I’m thankful that I have the endurance and can assume a posture that will never allow what you represent to ever be seen as everyday and ordinary.

      No, Mr. Trump, we will not all just get along. For as long as a threat to the state is the head of state, all citizens of good faith and national fidelity — and certainly this columnist — have an absolute obligation to meet you and your agenda with resistance at every turn.

      I know this in my bones, and for that I am thankful.<br><a class="bright" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/opinion/no-trump-we-cant-just-get-along.html" target="_blank">Continue Reading</a></h5>

      <h1>My meeting with Donald Trump: A damaged, pathetic personality — whose obvious impairment has only go
        <br>by Bill Curry</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>I arrived at Trump Tower in early evening, accompanied by my finance chair and an old friend and colleague. Stepping off the elevator into his apartment, we were met by a display of sterile, vulgar ostentation: all gold, silver, brass, marble; nothing soft, welcoming or warm. Trump soon appeared and we began to converse, but not really. In campaigns, we candidates do most of the talking; because we like to, and because people ask us lots of questions. Not this time. Not by a long shot.
          Trump talked very rapidly and virtually nonstop for nearly an hour; not of my campaign or even of politics, but only of himself, and almost always in the third person. He’d given himself a nickname: "the Trumpster," as in “everybody wants to know what the Trumpster’s gonna do,” a claim he made more than once.
          He mostly told stories. Some were about his business deals; others about trips he’d taken or things he owned. All were unrelated to the alleged point of our meeting, and to one another. That he seldom even attempted segues made each tale seem more disconnected from reality than the last. It was funny at first, then pathetic, and finally deeply unsettling.

        But an investigation by The New York Times into the financial maze of Mr. Trump’s real estate holdings in the United States reveals that companies he owns have at least $650 million in debt — twice the amount than can be gleaned from public filings he has made as part of his bid for the White House. The Times’s inquiry also found that Mr. Trump’s fortunes depend deeply on a wide array of financial backers, including one he has cited in attacks during his campaign.<br><a class="bright" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/politics/donald-trump-debt.html" target="_blank">Continue Reading</a></h5>

        <h5>At certain times Donald Trump has seemed like a budding authoritarian, a corrupt Nixon, a rabble-rousing populist or a big business corporatist.

          But as Trump has settled into his White House role, he has given a series of long interviews, and when you study the transcripts it becomes clear that fundamentally he is none of these things.

          At base, Trump is an infantalist. There are three tasks that most mature adults have sort of figured out by the time they hit 25. Trump has mastered none of them.

  <h5>Seven months ago, a respected former British spy named Christopher Steele won a contract to build a file on Donald J. Trump’s ties to Russia. Last week, the explosive details — unsubstantiated accounts of frolics with prostitutes, real estate deals that were intended as bribes and coordination with Russian intelligence of the hacking of Democrats — were summarized for Mr. Trump in an appendix to a top-secret intelligence report.

    The consequences have been incalculable and will play out long past Inauguration Day. Word of the summary, which was also given to President Obama and congressional leaders, leaked to CNN Tuesday, and the rest of the media followed with sensational reports.

    Mr. Trump denounced the unproven claims Wednesday as a fabrication, a Nazi-style smear concocted by “sick people.” It has further undermined his relationship with the intelligence agencies and cast a shadow over the new administration.<br><a class="bright" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-intelligence.html" target="_blank">Continue Reading</a></h5>

They fear the Republican nominee for president has emboldened the Kremlin in its unprecedented cybercampaign to disrupt elections in multiple countries in hopes of weakening Western alliances, according to intelligence, law enforcement and other government officials in the United States and Europe.

        While American intelligence officers have privately briefed Trump about Russia’s attempts to influence the U.S. election, he has publicly dismissed that information as unreliable, instead saying this hacking of incredible sophistication and technical complexity could have been done by some 400-pound “guy sitting on their bed” or even a child.<br><a class="bright" href="http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-russia-hillary-clinton-united-states-europe-516895" target="_blank">Continue Reading</a></h5>

          These charts illustrate dozens of those links, including meetings between Russian officials and members of Trump’s campaign and administration; his daughter’s ties to Putin’s friends; Trump’s 2013 visit to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant; and his short-lived mixed martial arts venture with one of Putin’s favorite athletes.

This article touches on some of that. But its central aim is to create a psychological portrait of the man. Who is he, really? How does his mind work?

              Trump could see they were helping him, they could see he appreciated it and was reciprocating. What, exactly, would have been the marginal benefit of some further secret communication making this happy symbiosis a matter of explicit agreement? Collusion would have been redundant.

              One benefit might be apprising the Trump campaign about what to expect, or inquiring as to what forms of assistance would be most useful.

                It is just one of many ways Trump will never measure up to the standards set by his predecessor, the African-American man whose birth as a U.S. citizen Trump infamously questioned for several years.

                Former President Barack Obama many times stepped in front of television cameras to talk the nation through tough times, most of them stemming from gun violence -- the massacre of children and teachers at Newtown; the shooting of Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman; the slayings of Dallas police officers; the death of Trayvon Martin.

                  All Americans, including the president, should feel comfortable criticizing the media. (I certainly do.) Specific media criticisms are part of the democratic cacophony. But Trump is doing something different.

He avoided prison time for that one by cooperating with law enforcement officials in their investigation and providing intelligence information -- apparently gleaned from government and intelligence contacts he had in Moscow -- to the U.S. government.

                    Sater later joined a real estate firm, the Bayrock Group, which did business from a suite of offices two floors beneath the Trump Organization's headquarters in Trump Tower.

                        "Donald Trump’s speech and behavior show that he has severe sociopathic traits. The significance of this cannot be overstated. While there have surely been American presidents who could be said to be narcissistic, none have shown sociopathic qualities to the degree seen in Mr. Trump. Correspondingly, none have been so definitively and so obviously dangerous. Democracy requires respect and protection for multiple points of view, concepts that are incompatible with sociopathy. The need to be seen as superior, when coupled with lack of empathy or remorse for harming other people, are in fact the signature characteristics of tyrants, who seek the control and destruction of all who oppose them, as well as loyalty to themselves instead of to the country they lead. The paranoia of severe sociopathy creates a profound risk of war, since heads of other nations will inevitably disagree with or challenge the sociopathic leader, who will experience the disagreement as a personal attack, leading to rage reactions and impulsive action to destroy this 'enemy.' A common historical example is the creation, by sociopathic leaders, of an international incident to have an excuse to seize more power (suspend constitutional rights, impose martial law, and discriminate against minority groups).

                        <br>
                        Because such leaders will lie to others in government and to their citizens, those who would check the sociopath’s power find it difficult to contradict his claims and actions with facts. Would-be tyrants also typically devalue a free press, undermining journalists’ ability to inform and resist the move toward war and away from democracy. Mr. Trump’s sociopathic characteristics are undeniable. They create a profound danger for America’s democracy and safety. Over time these characteristics will only become worse, either because Mr. Trump will succeed in gaining more power and more grandiosity with less grasp on reality, or because he will engender more criticism producing more paranoia, more lies, and more enraged destruction."
